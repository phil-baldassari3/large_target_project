"""
Wright-Fisher process on two differently sized genes. One gene has a longer CDS and more TFBS than the other.
In this simplistic model, a gene is expressed when each TFBS is bound by a TF at least once during a specified time period in ms.
A longer CDS has more chance for Non-synonymous mutation.

Model:
Each gene has a certain number of TFBS each with a probability score of it being bound by a TF at least once during a specified time period in ms.
The Cis-regulatory model score cooresponds to the probability that each TFBS was bound at least once during the specified time period.
The CDS recieves an initial score of one which indicates a normal gene product.
Each generation mutations are added based on a per site mutation rate. the number of mutations are sampled from a binomial distribution.
Mutations in TFBS affect the TFBS score propotianally. Multiplpiers are smalled from a normal distribution with a mean of -0.01 which indicates that on average mutation decrease the expression by 1%.
Mutations on CDS only affect functional if they are nonsynonymous which occurs with around 73% of all mutations in CDS. These muations also affect function propotianlly as in TFBS
The gene score is computed by multiplying Cis-regulatory model score and the CDS score. Since species is diploid, the scores of both homologs are averaged for an individual score.
These scores are analogous to a relative expression level. The scores are input into one of 3 fitness functions for selection at each genreation: i) linear, ii) parabolic, iii) sigmoidal.
The population of individuals are diploid and obligate outbreeding hermaphrodites. The genreation size remains constant.
